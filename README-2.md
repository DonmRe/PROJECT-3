# Jukebox

#### Intro
Jukebox is an app tailored to developers that are interested in tapping into a third-party API. At Jukebox, users can find easy access to a consolidated list of popular APIs for their reference. By the click of a button, developers will have direct access to their documentation so that may view their installation instructions without having to scramble through Google searches to find them. This app will provide ratings for an API's documenation, support, tools, and installation difficulty.

#### Approach 
This project will consist of two models: API and User. Our API model will include ratings for the components of an API that we previously mentioned (installation difficulty, documentation clarity, API difficulty) and will reveal whether there is support offered (such as an FAQ or a forum), as well as the number of tools offered. Full CRUD will be provided for users to create, edit, update, and delete their profile. For the minimum viable product, the ratings will be determined by the creators of this app, Squad Uno.

#### Stretch Goals
- Enable users with permission to rate the API components, so that we can provide user-ratings as well as pro-ratings. 
- Allow users to make a favorites list of the APIs they like the most
- Allow users to update their ratings

#### Unsolved Problems
Stay tuned...these are surely coming soon!
